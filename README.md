#### Stacks and Queues Summary (Layman's Style)</br>
My summary of Queues Taco Stand Sytle</br>
Welcome to the Taco Stand!</br>
Queue is processed in terms of "First in First Out" aka FIFO</br>
There are methods that execute the following when instantiated</br>
* Enqueue()</br>
This method adds an item at the end of the queue. (Think you now get in line for your tacos at the taco stand)</br>
* Dequeue()</br>
This method reads the queue and removes an item from the head of the queue. (Security has read the line (queue) and removed the jerk from the front of the line getting you one step closer to your tacos)</br>
* Peak()</br>
This method reads an item from the head of the queue but does nothing. (You are peaking at the front of the line for your tacos)</br>

STACK - collection where elements are processed "Last in First Out" aka LIFO</br>
For all of you/us JavaScript peeps....</br>
Push() and Pop() are back!</br>
* Push()</br>
This method puts a node on the top of the stack
* Pop()</br>
This method removes and returns a node from the top of the stack
* Peek()</br>
This method peeks at the top of the stack
